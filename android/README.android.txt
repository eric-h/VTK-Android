This directory is a collection of cmake scripts for android ndk build system.

Think of this as a generator of Android.mk files, similar to the cmake visual studio generator.
Hopefully will evolve into a generator eventually.
  
Make sure to use the crystax ndk as this is the only ndk tested. Justification: RTTI, stl, exceptions, etc...
